how would logging content work?
1. search content database for content that hasn't been logged?? [What if user searches for something they've already logged].
	idea: use case order to put unlogged stuff first and logged second and also label if you've logged it already.
2. Click on the content box that you want to add to your collection of logged content

	Idea: set the ID of each content box to be the serial id of the content in the database. give each button an onclick that sets the state of a passed down useState variable to be the content's ID. the state variable should default to null, so that once it's not null the form renders instead of the search bar.
3. Rerender the page to have a form for logging the selected piece of content. Get information about that piece of content from the database and use that to populate some pre-filled information about the show so that the user knows that they are logging what they want to log.
	Form fields:
		Status (dropdown)
		Rating (<input type="number" min="0" max="10" step="0.1">)
                Review (optional)
                Playtime (field conditional on content type being game)
